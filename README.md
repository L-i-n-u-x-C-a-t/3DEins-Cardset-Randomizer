# 3DEins Cardset Randomizer
A cardset randomizer for 3DEins. No idea why i did this.

This will randomize the cards in your game : for example, a blue 3 will look like a yellow 7.

### Instructions : 

Download the release in the Card_Generator folder (same folder as the makefile).
You still need to run make after that.
If you don't have 3DEins on your computer, you can download it [here](https://github.com/Universal-Team/3DEins/tree/v0.2.0/utils/Card_Generator). 
There should be a release for every OS, so you don't need python. but if there's not, or if this somewhat doesnt work, you can use the python file.
